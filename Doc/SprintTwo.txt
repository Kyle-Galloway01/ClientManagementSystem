Implement user authentication:
- Research the available authentication options in ASP.NET Core. 
- Explore ASP.NET Core Identity for user management and authentication, its a framework for handling authentication-related tasks.

Authentication Options in ASP.NET Core:
- Cookie Authentication:
    Uses encrypted cookies to authenticate users. Suitable for web applications where users log in using a username and password.
- JWT Authentication:
    Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. Useful for building stateless APIs where clients authenticate using tokens.
- OAuth2/OpenID Connect Authentication:
    Implements OAuth2 and OpenID Connect protocols for authentication with external providers such as Google, Facebook, or Azure AD.

ASP.NET Core Identity for User Management and Authentication:
- ASP.NET Core Identity is a membership system that adds user authentication and authorization capabilities to ASP.NET Core applications. 
  It provides the following features:
- User Registration: Allows users to create accounts by providing basic information such as username, email, and password.
- User Login: Authenticates users by verifying their credentials (username/email and password) against stored user data.
- Password Management: Handles password hashing, storage, and validation. Supports password policies for enforcing complexity requirements.
- Role-based Authorization: Assigns users to roles (e.g., admin, user) and restricts access to certain resources based on roles.
- Claims-based Authentication: Supports claims-based authentication, allowing users to have additional attributes (claims) associated with their identity.
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Provides options for enabling two-factor authentication methods such as SMS, email, or authenticator apps.
- Social Authentication: Integrates with external identity providers (e.g., Google, Facebook) for authentication through OAuth2/OpenID Connect.

For Our Project:
- ASP.NET Core Identity for user management and authentication. 
- user registration and login functionalities to allow users to create accounts and authenticate themselves securely.
- configure role-based authorization to control access to certain features based on user roles. 
- ASP.NET Core Identity will handle password management, ensuring that user passwords are securely stored and validated according to specified policies.
